    <h1>Fried Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      An intensely flavored buttermilk brine tenderizes the chicken while
      keeping it moist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding wet ingredients to the dry flour coating ensures an extra-craggy
      crust with lots of nooks and crannies. Starting in hot fat and finishing
      in the oven gives you fried chicken with a crisp crust and evenly cooked
      meat.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 whole chicken, about 4 pounds, cut into 10 pieces or 3 1/2 pounds
        bone-in, skin-on breasts, legs, drumsticks, and/or wings
      </li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>4 cups vegetable shortening</li>
      <li>buttermilk brine</li>
      <li>spice mix</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and cayenne
        in a small bowl and mix thoroughly with a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk the buttermilk, egg, 1 tablespoon salt, and 2 tablespoons of the
        spice mixture in a large bowl. Add the chicken pieces and toss and turn
        to coat. Transfer the contents of the bowl to a gallon-sized zipper-lock
        freezer bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, and up to overnight,
        flipping the bag occasionally to redistribute the contents and coat the
        chicken evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, 2 teaspoons salt,
        and the remaining spice mixture in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons of
        the marinade from the zipper-lock bag and work it into the flour with
        your fingertips. Remove one piece of chicken from the bag, allowing
        excess buttermilk to drip off, drop the chicken into the flour mixture,
        and toss to coat. Continue adding chicken pieces to the flour mixture
        one at a time until they are all in the bowl. Toss the chicken until
        every piece is thoroughly coated, pressing with your hands to get the
        flour to adhere in a thick layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to
        350°F. Heat the shortening or oil to 425°F in a 12-inch straight-sided
        cast-iron chicken fryer or a large wok over medium-high heat. Adjust the
        heat as necessary to maintain the temperature, being careful not to let
        the fat get any hotter.
      </li>
      <li>
        One piece at a time, transfer the coated chicken to a fine-mesh strainer
        and shake to remove excess flour. Transfer to a wire rack set on a
        rimmed baking sheet. Once all the chicken pieces are coated, place skin
        side down in the pan. The temperature should drop to 300°F; adjust the
        heat to maintain the temperature at 300°F for the duration of the
        cooking. Fry the chicken until it’s a deep golden brown on the first
        side, about 6 minutes; do not move the chicken or start checking for
        doneness until it has fried for at least 3 minutes, or you may knock off
        the coating. Carefully flip the chicken pieces with tongs and cook until
        the second side is golden brown, about 4 minutes longer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chicken to a clean wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet,
        season lightly with salt, and place in the oven. Bake until thickest
        part of breast pieces registers 150°F (65.5°C) on an instant-read
        thermometer, and thigh/drumstick pieces register 165°F (74°C), 5 to 10
        minutes; remove chicken pieces as they reach their target temperature,
        and transfer to a second wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, or a
        paper towel-lined plate. Season with salt to taste. Serve
        immediately—or, for extra-crunchy fried chicken, proceed to step 7.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the plate of cooked chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1
        hour, and up to overnight. When ready to serve, reheat the oil to 400°F.
        Add the chicken pieces and cook, flipping them once halfway through
        cooking, until completely crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire
        rack set on a rimmed baking sheet to drain, then serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
